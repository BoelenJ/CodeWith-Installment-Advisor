    "Content": "Q: What are renewable energy sources and why are they important?\nA: Renewable energy sources are natural resources that can be replenished naturally over time, such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass energy. They are important because they produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions, help reduce dependence on fossil fuels, create jobs in emerging industries, and provide sustainable energy solutions for future generations. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable sources won't run out and help combat climate change.",

    "Content": "Q: How do solar panels work and what are their benefits?\nA: Solar panels work by converting sunlight into electricity through photovoltaic cells. When sunlight hits the solar cells, it knocks electrons loose from atoms, generating a flow of electricity. The benefits include: reduced electricity bills, low maintenance costs, increased property value, environmental sustainability, energy independence, and long-term savings. Modern solar panels can last 25-30 years and have become increasingly efficient and affordable.",

    "Content": "Q: What is energy efficiency and how can I improve it in my home?\nA: Energy efficiency means using less energy to provide the same level of service or output. To improve home energy efficiency: install LED lighting, upgrade to ENERGY STAR appliances, improve insulation, seal air leaks, use programmable thermostats, install energy-efficient windows, maintain HVAC systems regularly, and consider smart home technologies. These improvements can reduce energy bills by 10-30% and increase comfort while reducing environmental impact.",

    "Content": "Q: What are the environmental impacts of different energy sources?\nA: Different energy sources have varying environmental impacts. Fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) produce greenhouse gases, air pollution, and water contamination. Nuclear energy produces radioactive waste but low emissions. Renewable sources have minimal environmental impact during operation: solar and wind have no emissions during use, hydroelectric can affect local ecosystems, geothermal has minimal surface impact, and biomass is carbon-neutral when managed sustainably. The lifecycle environmental cost of renewables is significantly lower than fossil fuels.",
